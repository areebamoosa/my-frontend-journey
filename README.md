# My Frontend Journey

Welcome to **My Frontend Journey** â€“ a personal breakdown of my learning path in front-end development.

Although Iâ€™ve already completed the initial learning of **HTML** and **CSS**, this repository restructures that knowledge into a clear, topic-based documentation format.

## ðŸ“˜ What's Inside

- Structured notes on core HTML & CSS concepts  
- Ongoing updates as I continue to learn and grow  

ðŸš€ What's Next

This repository will expand to include my continued learning in:

- **JavaScript** â€“ for interactive functionality  
- **CSS Frameworks** â€“ including **Tailwind CSS** and **Bootstrap**  
- **React** â€“ for building dynamic user interfaces  

These technologies form the core stack of my front-end development journey.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This repo helps me:
- Reinforce and organise what I've learned  
- Track my progress over time   

##  Still in Progress

I'm continuously updating this repository as I revisit key topics, explore deeper concepts, and build more complex projects.
